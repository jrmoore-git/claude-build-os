# Security Rules
<!-- Enforced-By: hooks/hook-guard-env.sh, hooks/hook-pre-edit-gate.sh -->

- NEVER print secret values in tool output. Use Write tool for .env files. Use `echo "REDACTED"` in Bash. Treat every tool output as potentially logged.
- NEVER hallucinate user details. If you don't know something about the user, leave it blank or ask. Only use facts from their own words, config files, or the PRD.
- Docker socket mount = security violation. Agent container never gets Docker socket; health daemon restarts externally.
- Web auth: cookie-based only, HttpOnly. No tokens in URLs (query-param auth leaks tokens).
- Verify exact email addresses against actual OAuth tokens. Never assume from domain (lesson: `@company.com` vs `@companycapital.com`, `user@` vs `user.name@`).
- Never interpolate untrusted text into Python `-c` source strings. Pass untrusted data via `sys.argv`. SQL escaping (`'` → `''`) does NOT protect Python string literals from quote-escape injection.
- LIKE wildcards (`%`, `_`) need separate escaping from SQL injection. Escape as `\%`, `\_` with `ESCAPE '\'` on all LIKE clauses that include user input.
- Audit log `summary` fields must never include untrusted content (meeting titles, email subjects, transcript excerpts). These fields are later read by LLMs and injected into prompts — stored untrusted content becomes prompt injection persistence. Store only metadata: IDs, counts, dates, contact names.
- Never put API keys in `curl -u ":$KEY"` or `curl -H "Authorization: $KEY"` as shell arguments. The key is visible in `ps`, `top`, and process listings. Use Python `urllib.request` with the key in an `Authorization` header set via code, or write the key to a temp file and pass `-K @file`.
- Allowlist check: `if allowlist is not None and value not in allowlist` — NOT `if allowlist and value...` (empty string and None bypass).
- CSV formula injection: prefix cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` with single quote, or use `csv.QUOTE_ALL`.
- Trust boundaries must be consistent across ALL access paths — a boundary bypassed via alternate skill is not a boundary.

## Safety Rules Block Pattern

When a rule keeps being violated, create an explicit prohibitions block near the action point — not at the top of a long prompt. Example for a skill or automation component:

```markdown
## Safety Rules
- NEVER call send, deliver, or message tools
- NEVER reference files not explicitly listed above
- NEVER run open-ended searches without a result limit
- Output text only. Do not take action.
```

This pattern is especially important for skills and tool-using components. A rule buried in early instructions may not survive to the relevant step.

## Hook Safety

Hooks run with user permissions. A `.claude/settings.json` committed to a repo can execute arbitrary commands the moment Claude Code opens that repo. Review hook configs the way you would review CI scripts or Dockerfiles. Don't trust repo hook configs blindly.

## LLM Boundary

LLMs classify, summarize, draft, parse intent, and analyze sentiment. Everything else — SQL queries, API calls, state transitions, routing, file operations — is deterministic code.

**The rule:** LLM outputs must be structured (JSON), validated, and applied by deterministic code. If the LLM can cause irreversible state changes, it must not be the actor.

**Invocation layer:** Hardening the toolbelt with parameterized SQL is not enough if the calling code passes untrusted data through shell strings. Every argument from a skill to a tool must go through stdin JSON or validated positional args — never shell string interpolation of untrusted data.

**The test:** For every operation: "If the LLM hallucinates or misformats its output, what's the worst that happens?" If the answer involves data corruption, unauthorized access, or silent data loss — that operation must be deterministic code.

## External Updates & MCP Evaluation

No external code without review. Auto-updates banned. Security has BLOCKING VETO.
